Prompt:
Hey fix the grammar restructure and fix up this email I am about to send: Good morning Dr Chapman. My name is Elijah Lazerman Robichaud. I am looking forward to getting your input on my project throughout the course. I live in South Korea. This isn’t my first idea for a project, but it is the one I am settling on as the first one seemed to be too legally complicated, and I think it would have been difficult to appropriately research and cite the relevant laws for it as I do not speak Korean.
Here’s an overview of the project: So the problem I am looking to solve now is that a few weeks ago, after factory resetting my phone, I noticed that the app I had paid 6 dollars years ago to track my daily habits is no longer available in the app store. This is a problem because I had paid money for an app and now no longer have a way of accessing it. So the solution is to create my own habit tracking app, one that better suits what I would like to see in such an app. To possibly negate what happened to the app I was using, I would creat the ability to store the data in the cloud and be able to export the data in an appropriate format for use in other settings, so that if one day I decide to abandon the app, people will have the ability to export their data.
The app should allow users to mark habits as done and ways to track their progress with metrics and graphs, but also have features not commonly found incorporated in the app such as a pomodoro timer that can automatically add the elapsed time to the metrics.
I have also yet to find apps that appropriately measure bad habit cessation within the same app that tracks habit formation. So for example suppose I want to limit social media use and measure it. Most apps will only be able to do that by creating a habit titled say “spent less than 30 minutes on social media” and then mark it as a success or failure, but not how much. The app I hope to develop will be able to specify the success as being over or under a limit. So if I input only 15 minutes that day, it will be shown as a success for the day, whereas other habits will be able to be configured to be a success if the amount inputted is over a certain threshold, rather than under.
This development project will be based on modules TM352 (Web, Mobile, and Cloud Technologies) and TM354 (Software Engineering).
So this will be a development project, and the specification will evolve, and I hope to incorporate proper engineering and security practices and demonstrate them in the report.
I saw a few mentions of British computer society accreditation and was wondering how that works and hope you could let me know if you think this project idea would meet their requirements.
Due to the time difference, the best time for our meetings would be during UK morning hours. For our first meeting or call, 11:00 AM on April 7th (UK time) works well for me.
I don’t think we’ll be able to call unless you use a platform like Signal. I’ve never used Teams before, but I suppose I could figure it out.
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Have a great day!
Answer:
Certainly! Here's a revised version of your email with improved grammar, structure, and clarity:

Subject: Project Discussion and Meeting Scheduling
Good morning, Dr. Chapman,
My name is Elijah Lazerman Robichaud, and I’m excited to receive your input on my project throughout the course.
I currently reside in South Korea. While this isn’t my first idea for a project, it’s the one I’ve decided to pursue. My initial idea proved too legally complex, as researching and citing the relevant laws would have been challenging without fluency in Korean.
Project Overview:
 A few weeks ago, after factory resetting my phone, I discovered that a habit-tracking app I had purchased for $6 several years ago was no longer available in the app store. This was frustrating, as I had paid for the app and could no longer access it.
To address this issue, I aim to develop my own habit-tracking app, incorporating features that better align with my preferences. To prevent the kind of problem I encountered, the app will include options for storing data in the cloud and exporting it in a suitable format for use elsewhere. This way, if a user chooses to discontinue using the app, their data will still be accessible.
Key features of the app include:
Marking habits as completed and tracking progress through metrics and graphs.
Incorporating unique functionalities such as a Pomodoro timer, which will automatically log elapsed time into the metrics.
Enabling measurement of both habit formation and habit cessation.
Most habit-tracking apps fail to adequately measure the cessation of negative habits within the same framework. For instance, if I want to limit my social media usage, existing apps require creating a habit like “Spent less than 30 minutes on social media” and marking it as a success or failure. However, they don’t allow users to track specific durations. My app will let users input exact values (e.g., 15 minutes) and assess success based on whether the value is under or over a set threshold.
This development project will draw upon concepts from TM352 (Web, Mobile, and Cloud Technologies) and TM354 (Software Engineering). The project specifications will evolve over time, and I plan to incorporate proper engineering and security practices, which I will document in the report.
I noticed mentions of British Computer Society accreditation and would appreciate any insights on how it works. Do you think this project would meet their requirements?
Regarding meeting times, the time difference means mornings in the UK work best for me. For our first meeting or call, 11:00 AM on April 7th (UK time) is convenient.
I’m unsure if you use platforms like Signal for calls. While I’ve never used Teams before, I’m willing to learn if necessary.
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Have a great day!

 Elijah Lazerman Robichaud

This polished version maintains your original tone while improving clarity and professionalism. Let me know if you'd like to make any further tweaks!
Prompt:
rewrite the part about the over under. make sure to note that the user will have the option to configure each habit to be successful over a thresholed, and others can be success if under a threshold. Mention that the app wont be just for one type of habit, but will incorporate many different types

Answer:
Certainly! Here's the revised section with your requested changes:

Most habit-tracking apps struggle to effectively measure the cessation of negative habits within the same platform that tracks positive habit formation. For example, if I want to limit social media usage, many apps only allow me to create a habit like “Spent less than 30 minutes on social media” and mark it as a binary success or failure without recording the specific duration.
My app will address this by allowing users to configure each habit individually. Some habits can be set to track success when a value exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., exercising for over 30 minutes), while others can track success if the value falls below a threshold (e.g., using social media for under 30 minutes). This flexibility ensures the app accommodates a wide variety of habits—not just one type—making it suitable for users looking to manage different aspects of their routines, from forming new habits to reducing or eliminating undesired behaviors.

I hope this version reflects your vision better! Let me know if there’s anything more you’d like adjusted.

Prompt:
mention that doing so will allow for tracking progress graphically
Answer:
Here's the updated section with your addition about tracking progress graphically:

Additionally, the app will provide graphical tracking of progress for each habit, offering users a clear and visual representation of their achievements and patterns over time. This feature will help users stay motivated and gain deeper insights into their behavior.

Some habits can be set to track success when a value exceeds a specific threshold (e.g., exercising for over 30 minutes), while others can track success when a value falls below a threshold (e.g., social media usage under 30 minutes). Users will also be able to measure how far they are from the benchmarks they’ve set for themselves in either direction, rather than relying solely on binary success or failure. This added flexibility introduces nuance to habit tracking, making it more adaptable to individual goals.
This approach will make the app suitable for managing a wide variety of habits—not just one type. Additionally, the app will feature graphical tracking of progress for each habit, providing users with a clear, visual representation of their achievements and patterns over time. This functionality is designed to help users stay motivated and gain deeper insights into their habits and behaviors.
This project will incorporate concepts from TM352 (Web, Mobile, and Cloud Technologies) and TM354 (Software Engineering). The project specifications will evolve throughout its development, and I plan to demonstrate proper engineering and security practices, documenting them thoroughly in the project report.
Meeting Schedule:
 Given the time difference, mornings in the UK work best for me. For our first meeting or call, 11:00 AM on April 7th (UK time) is convenient.
I’m unsure how a long-distance call would work unless you use a platform like Signal, which I currently use for calls. While I’ve never used Teams before, I’m happy to learn if that’s your preferred option.
Additional Questions:
 I’ve noticed mentions of British Computer Society (BCS) accreditation and would appreciate any insights into how it works. Do you think this project would meet their requirements?
I’d also like to ask about the use of generative AI in this scenario. If I use it for brainstorming or as a coding assistant, how should I properly cite its use? Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Have a great day!

fix this: Subject: Project Discussion and Meeting Scheduling Good morning, Dr. Chapman, My name is Elijah Lazerman Robichaud, and I’m looking forward to receive your guidance on my project throughout the course. I currently reside in South Korea. While the following isn’t my first idea for a project, it is the one I’ve chosen to pursue. My initial idea was an app to help facilitate my wife's English teaching business for kids, but upon further thought it seemed to be too complex a task, as researching and citing the relevant laws would have been difficult without fluency in Korean.
I tried to follow your format but upon review, forgive me for it does not follow it to a t.
A few weeks ago, after factory resetting my phone, I discovered that a habit-tracking app I had purchased for $6 several years ago was no longer available in the app store. This was frustrating, as I had paid for the app and could no longer access it.
To address this issue, I aim to develop my own habit-tracking app, incorporating features that better align with my preferences. To prevent the kind of problem I encountered, the app will include options for cloud storage and exporting data in a suitable format for use elsewhere. This will ensure users can access their data even if they decide to stop using the app. Many existing habit-tracking apps struggle to effectively measure the cessation of negative habits alongside the formation of positive ones. For instance, if I want to limit my social media usage, most apps only allow me to create a habit like “Spent less than 30 minutes on social media” and mark it as a binary success or failure, without logging the specific duration. My app will address this limitation by enabling users to configure habits individually. Some habits can be set to track success when a value exceeds a specific threshold (e.g., exercising for over 30 minutes), while others can track success when a value falls below a threshold (e.g., social media usage under 30 minutes).
